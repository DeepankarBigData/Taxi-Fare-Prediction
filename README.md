## Project Goal <a name="project-goal"></a>
This complete project is made as a part of PG Diploma in Big Data Analytics as a final Project at C-DAC HYDERABAD.

## Technical Aspects <a name="technical-aspects"></a>
The whole project has been divided into three parts. These are listed as follows :

**Data Preparation**: This consists of storing our data into mongoDB database and utilizing it, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, EDA, etc.

• 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 : In this step, we use the resultant data after the implementation of the previous step to cross validate our Machine Learning model and perform Hyperparameter optimization based on various performance metrics in order to make our model predict as accurate results as possible.

• 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 : This step include creation of a front-end using HTML,CSS, and using Flask API back-end and deployed it on local host.

- Deepankar Pawar\
  I am writing to introduce myself—Deepankar Pawar—a talented individual with a profound passion for the field of data science. I am not just a data enthusiast; I am a dedicated practitioner and a fervent advocate for 
  the intersection of technology and data-driven insights.

  I have demonstrated exceptional expertise in the realms of data science, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). My commitment to staying at the forefront of these rapidly evolving fields is evident in my 
  continuous pursuit of knowledge and skills. Whether it's crafting sophisticated machine learning models, delving into the intricacies of deep learning algorithms, or exploring the frontiers of AI, I approach each 
  challenge with enthusiasm and a deep analytical mindset.

  What sets me apart is not only my technical proficiency but also my keen interest in deploying data-driven solutions in real-world scenarios. My ability to bridge the gap between theory and application, coupled with a 
  focus on effective deployment strategies, makes me a valuable asset in any data-centric project.

  In addition to my technical skills, I am a collaborative team member, always eager to share my insights and learn from others.

  I am confident that my passion for data science and my expertise in AI and deep learning can make a meaningful impact in any project or collaboration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute 
  to your team.
  
  Thank You
